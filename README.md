1. How to Import an existing Flutter Project in Android Studio?
   Let’s say we have already had a Flutter Project in the directory named Flutter. Before importing this project into the Android Studio we have to install two plugins in the Android Studio, here’s how we do it.
   
Step 1: Open the Android Studio and select Tools from the menu bar and click on SDK Manager.

Step 2: In the newly open window click on the plugins and in the search bar search for Flutter and Dart and then install it.

Step 3: Now after installing Flutter and Dart we are ready to import a Flutter project. For that just go for File>New>Import Project.

Step 4: Now in the new pop-up window go for the directory in which the Flutter project is already available in this case we have a currency_application project. Click on that directory and we have successfully imported an existing Flutter project in Android Studio.

Step 5: Now there will be a default .dart page over there which has already a sample code written on it and we can check it by running the application by selecting Chrome web as our device and clicking on the Green play button to run the application and we can see our result on the web page.
